There are new implementations of most of the major programming systems in the book, including the interpreters and compilers, and the authors have incorporated many small changes that reflect their experience teaching the course at MIT since the first edition was published. A new theme has been introduced that emphasizes the central role played by different approaches to dealing with time in computational models: objects with state, concurrent programming, functional programming and lazy evaluation, and nondeterministic programming. There are new example sections on higher-order procedures in graphics and on applications of stream processing in numerical programming, and many new exercises.

The exercises are not focused on a language, but on a design process. The exercises are not hypothetical, but must lead directly to working programs. This book can also help managers develop a level of comfort with the process of OO software development. This book allows the reader to explore the processes and artifacts of OO design before project deadlines make good design seem impossible.\",\n      },\n      {\n        title: \"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs\",\n        author: \"Harold Abelson, Gerald Jay Sussman, and Julie Sussman\",\n        url: \"https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/\",\n        shortDescription:\n          \"Wizard Book n.

This long-awaited revision contains changes throughout the text. There are new implementations of most of the major programming systems in the book, including the interpreters and compilers, and the authors have incorporated many small changes that reflect their experience teaching the course at MIT since the first edition was published. A new theme has been introduced that emphasizes the central role played by different approaches to dealing with time in computational models: objects with state, concurrent programming, functional programming and lazy evaluation, and nondeterministic programming. There are new example sections on higher-order procedures in graphics and on applications of stream processing in numerical programming, and many new exercises. In addition, all the programs have been reworked to run in any Scheme implementation that adheres to the IEEE standard.\",\n        }])\n    return (\n        <main>\n            <h1>Freeshelf: free online coding resources</h1>\n                {books.map((book, idx) => {\n                return (\n                    <Book title={book.title} author={book.author} key={idx} id={idx} url={book.url} shortDescription={book.shortDescription} coverImageUrl={book.coverImageUrl} publisher={book.publisher} publicationDate={book.publicationDate} />\n            )})}\n        </main>\n        )\n    \n}\n\n\nexport const Book = (props) => {\n  const { id, title, author, url, shortDescription, coverImageUrl, publisher, publicationDate} = props\n\n  return (\n    <div id={id} className=''>\n      <h2>{title}</h2>\n      <img src={coverImageUrl}></img>\n      <p>{author}</p>\n      <p>{shortDescription}</p>\n      <a href=\"{url}\">{url}</a>\n      <p>{publisher}</p>\n      <p>{publicationDate}</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default App;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
